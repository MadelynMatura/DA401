# Overview of the Project

The major goal of this study is to investigate the effect of healthcare system type on public health from a global perspective. Most recent studies have focused on the before and after effects of healthcare system changes in individual countries. However, this study aims to generate an inclusive and generalized approach to assessing public health deficits that arise based on the different healthcare system types that exist in the world. A variety of low, middle, and high income countries have been included in this study. Based on the results of previous studies, I hypothesized that universal healthcare systems would have increased positive healthcare outcomes, in comparison to non-universal systems. 

# The Data

The data comes from the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO keeps track of various health indicators for every country in the world on a yearly basis. These health indicators will be used in order to create indices that represent overall physical, mental, and total health in every country. These will be compared across system types, which include: universal government funded, universal public insurance, universal public and private insurance, universal private insurance, and non-universal insurance systems. Countries have been sorted into healthcare system types using their individual WHO profiles, and the Social Security Admininstration's individual country profiles from 2016. 


# The Code
The code created for this project takes advantage of the WHO API, using the WHO package in R created by github user expersso. Data wrangling, analyses and visualization has been completed in R.
